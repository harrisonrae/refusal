             2021: Next to a car park in Parra I watched Snoee Badman — the first Australian to release an EP from inside a maximum-security prison.
            I remember him wearing all white and with his face covered. It was a celebration of someone defiantly creative, resisting the systems silencing.
Fred Moten wrote in a paper on fugitive aesthetics about the potential for art to refuse commodification and resist the logics of capital and coloniality.
            Releasing a tape from behind bars felt like it resonated with parts of what Moten wrote, as well as a "fuck you" to the gaol system. I was eager to join in this, in this safe kind of contradictory implicit and explicit way in the Erby Street Car Park.
            Connected together in some kind of moment of alterity, as performer and listener.

            Midway through 2024 I showed a sculptural work in a gallery.
            The work was a cairn of sandstone, mirroring a cairn in Centennial Park erected for John Busby.
            My work continued a dialogue between local Government, Centennial Parklands group and myself.
            This dialogue started when I began tiling at the entrance of Busby's Bore in Centennial Park to contest the version of colonial history presenting Busby favourably with cairns, suburbs and ponds named after him.
           </p>
           <p> In celebrating Busby we are complicit in erasing histories of Sydney. Erasing the histories of the penal colony and their role in the construction of this heritage-listed work.
            Erasing over 40,000 years of Aboriginal histories through the destruction and renaming of sites.
          The cairn in the gallery was made of found-sandstone (the material quarried by convicts for 10 years to create this tunnel). These stones were sourced while tracing the map of the bore from Centennial Park to Hyde Park.
            </p>
            
            <p> My intention was to create a counter-myth to muddy the story of Busby. To refuse that colonial narratives naturalisation and its legibility.
               De Certeau emphasizes the power of storytelling as an act of resistance, since it allows individuals to create narratives that counter official histories and sanctioned discourses.
               Through storytelling, we can resist passive consumption of cultural narratives and instead become creators of meaning, sustaining communal identity and memory.
                In saying this, an image of the sandstone cairn standing in the gallery reminds me to be mindful of what I make legible and illegible.

            On the 426 up Marrickville Road the lane heading towards Sydenham Station is closed.
            Police and paramedics are outside Guzman y Gomez and the bus continues toward Dulwich Hill. </p>
            Same bus next day someone plays the news loudly from their phone.
            I overhear that the police operation was because around 7:40pm last night-a Monday night-a man was killed in front of his family having dinner at GYG.
            The man who allegedly stabbed him was Snoee Badman.

            Recently under a blog titled 'refusal', my friend posted a Cao Fei short film.
            With only 153 seconds, the films excerpt depicts parallel realites and explores relationships of humanity and freedom through a dialogue between a prisoner and architect.
            In the excerpt, we see the pair engaging in ideas of visible and invisible imprisonment.
         </p>
         <p>
            In a block of text beneath the video I copied two things into my notes.
         </p>
         <p>
            First: "the pursuit of freedom is human nature."
         The second thing I wrote was how the text described the video as the artists attempts at reconciling the world with human nature.
              </p>
          <p>  Naively, I imagine how I would reconcile the world and human nature, thinking the answer was in range.
            I understand from the text I copied that if human nature is the pursuit of freedom, then the world is the force that prevents it.

            September 21st, an alternative milk company advertises their brand with pasteups. The images are mugshots; the text states “oat dealer”...
            There is something so surface-level about adopting this aesthetic to advertise oat milk. To perform alterity.
<p>
    This isn't what Fred Moten was talking about when he says 'fugitive aesthetics'.
        </p>
            Walking toward Marrickville Road I hear a friend call my name.
            Her boyfriend posted a Cao Fei short film on his blog 'refusal'.
            Together they are hosting a monthly workshop of letter writing to people in Correctional Centres.
            I'm confronted with the reality of how I've adopted a fugitive-aesthetic:
            I'm writing about fugitivity with limited engagement. I've written about resisting power structures with hypertext.
            I have listened to stories about Bushrangers in Tassie; becoming fugitives from circumstance.
            My Instagram feed updates me on the current frontline of colonisation, where families in Palestine and Southern Lebanon are forced to leave their homes, or face risk of becoming fugitives if they refuse.
            I haven't given much thought to people in circumstances more similar to my time and place.
            People who had similarities, who have been apprehended and are now legible to the State as a numeric prisoner ID.
            In participating in this workshop, I consider my own legibility; how does the State read me?
            I don't think I am worth the states time; I use an alias anyway.
            I'm no longer sure how to differentiate how an oat milk brand and I engage with fugitivity.
