             2021: Next to a car park in Parra I watched Snoee Badman — the first Australian to release an EP from inside a maximum-security prison.
            I remember him wearing all white and with his face covered. It was a celebration of someone defiantly creative, resisting the systems silencing.
Fred Moten wrote in a paper on fugitive aesthetics about the potential for art to refuse commodification and resist the logics of capital and coloniality.
            Releasing a tape from behind bars felt like it resonated with parts of what Moten wrote, as well as a "fuck you" to the gaol system. I was eager to join in this, in this safe kind of contradictory implicit and explicit way in the Erby Street Car Park.
            Connected together in some kind of moment of alterity, as performer and listener.

            Midway through 2024 I showed a sculptural work in a gallery.
            The work was a cairn of sandstone, mirroring a cairn in Centennial Park erected for John Busby.
            My work continued a dialogue between local Government, Centennial Parklands group and myself.
            This dialogue started when I began tiling at the entrance of Busby's Bore in Centennial Park to contest the version of colonial history presenting Busby favourably with cairns, suburbs and ponds named after him.
           </p>
           <p> In celebrating Busby we are complicit in erasing histories of Sydney. Erasing the histories of the penal colony and their role in the construction of this heritage-listed work.
            Erasing over 40,000 years of Aboriginal histories through the destruction and renaming of sites.
          The cairn in the gallery was made of found-sandstone (the material quarried by convicts for 10 years to create this tunnel). These stones were sourced while tracing the map of the bore from Centennial Park to Hyde Park.
            </p>
            
            <p> My intention was to create a counter-myth to muddy the story of Busby. To refuse that colonial narratives naturalisation and its legibility.
               De Certeau emphasizes the power of storytelling as an act of resistance, since it allows individuals to create narratives that counter official histories and sanctioned discourses.
               Through storytelling, we can resist passive consumption of cultural narratives and instead become creators of meaning, sustaining communal identity and memory.
                In saying this, an image of the sandstone cairn standing in the gallery reminds me to be mindful of what I make legible and illegible.

            On the 426 up Marrickville Road the lane heading towards Sydenham Station is closed.
            Police and paramedics are outside Guzman y Gomez and the bus continues toward Dulwich Hill. </p>
            Same bus next day someone plays the news loudly from their phone.
            I overhear that the police operation was because around 7:40pm last night-a Monday night-a man was killed in front of his family having dinner at GYG.
            The man who allegedly stabbed him was Snoee Badman.
