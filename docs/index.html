            I never considered that the term fugitive isn’t static. 
            Fugitivity depends upon the hierarchies and systems of power that one exists under. 
            A fugitive may flee from somewhere, to become a refugee in a place with different laws and values.

            A talk by Paul Soulellis titled "publishing as practice as resistance" articulates a thought that I had been approaching but not yet arrived at.
            He said: "I'm looking more and more towards critical writing, not visual art, for clues about how to deal with crisis, particularly around failure and futurity."
            I found truth in this; the critical writing I've read recently seems more appropriate for negotiating with systems of power.
            However the articulation of how to negotiate I understand may not be fitting for my identity and circumstance.

            Jack Halberstam introduced me to the idea of 'resisting legibility'. 
            With my finger tracing the screen left to right I read the definition of legibility as "quality clear enough to be read". 
            What does it mean to resist this?
            I wondered about the definition of illegible, whether it would help to explicate the parameters of this discussion.
            The search-engine stated its definition as "impossible or near impossible to read". 
            Paul Soulellis, an academic writing on the resistance in publishing has a more optimistic understanding of illegibility and resisting legibility.
            Soulellis' understanding is that illegibility does not result in the impossibility of a reading or an inability to solicit any meaning.
            Instead Soulellis spoke of illegibility as being able to generate a variety of valid readings and interpretations.
            'Resisting legibility' is therefore resisting a singular reading of identity. 
            A refusal to be blunted by sharp lines of definition.

            James C. Scott, in Seeing Like a State, explores how states attempt to make societies legible for the purposes of control.
            The legibility of a society in turn allows the state to act in ways to prevent and counter the actions taken by members of society which are not a part of the states goals. 
            'Resisting legibility' and refusing the state this level of control is important to maintain a level of agency and autonomy. 
            Through everyday actions as a gesture of refusal, a rejection of institutional desire to define myself for the imposition of regulation. 
            A strategy to avoid being easily categorised and controlled by dominant systems of power. 
            A refusal of prerequisite definitions is a denial of the legitimacy of laws and regulations; 
            does this mean that in engaging with illegibility that I am engaging with a form of fugitivity?

            September 21, an alternative milk company advertises their brand with pasteups. The images are mugshots; the text states “oat dealer”...
            There is something surface-level about adopting a fugitive-aesthetic to advertise oat milk.
            Wandering, wondering, approaching Marrickville road I hear a friend say my name.
            Her boyfriend posted a Cao Fei short film on his blog 'refusal'.
            Together they are hosting a monthly workshop of letter writing to people in correction centres.
            I'm confronted with the reality of how I've adopted a fugitive-aesthetic;
            I'm writing about fugitivity with a limited engagement. I've written about resisting power structures.
            I've listened to stories about Australian Bushrangers in Tasmania who became fugitives from circumstance.
            My instagram feed updates me on the current frontline of colonisation, where families in Palestine and Southern Lebanon are forced to leave their homes, or face risk of becoming fugitives if they refuse.
            I haven't given much thought to people in circumstances more similar to my time and place.
            People who had similarities, who have been apprehended and are now legible as a numeric prisoner ID.
            In participating in this workship, I consider my own legibility; how does the state read me?
            Not worth their time, I use an alias anyway. I'm no longer sure how to differentiate how an oat milk brand and I use fugitivity.

            Earlier this year at a gallery in Paddington I presented a new sculptural work. The work was a cairn of sandstone, to mirror a cairn in Centennial Park erected for John Busby.
            My work continued a dialog between local Government, Centennial Parklands group and myself.
            This dialog started when I began tiling at Centennial Park at the entrance of Busby's bore to contest the version of history presented in Sydney with cairns, suburbs and ponds named after John Busby.
            In acknowledging Busby I found we are complicit in erasing histories of Sydney, namely the role of convicts in the creation of heritage-listed work.
            The cairn in the gallery was made up of found-sandstone (the material quarried by convicts for 10 years to create this tunnel) that I had found while tracing the map of Busby's bore from Centennial Park to Hyde Park. 
            The cairn of rocks stood in the gallery as a refusal of the attempts to valorise John Busby, I sought to create a counter-myth to contradict the narrative that is naturalised through the naming of places after Busby.
            With the fragments of archival materials I could find about the convicts, I was interested in using Saidiya Hartman's process of 'critical fabulations' for generative storytelling to manifest about 18th Century Sydney.

           Recently under a blog titled 'refusal', my friend posted a Cao Fei short film. 
           With only 153 seconds the films excerpt depicts parallel realites, exploring relationships of humanity and freedom through a dialogue between a prisoner and architect.
           In the film excerpt, we see the pair engaging in ideas of visible and invisible iimprisonment.
           In a block of text beneath the video I highlighted two things. 
           First: "For Hegel, the pursuit of freedom is human nature." The second is an attempt to understand the videos content, suggesting that the vieo is the artists attempts at reconciliation with the world and human nature.
           Naively, I imagine how I would reconcile the world and human nature, thinking the answer was in range.
           To unpack the two things I highlighted, I gather that if human nature is the pursuit of freedom, then the world is the force that prevents this.
           A third thing I highlighted: "Existentialism is used as a tool for self-redemption."

            I've used aliases before. For vulnerable artistic projects, to mislead suspicious characters and have fun with coffee orders.
            Not instances for avoiding dominant powers and evading systems of control.
            On the bus home I reason to myself that my resistance of legibility is a small refusal to be complicit in the same system as one that I see manifests state sanctioned violence and racism.

            Fugitivity is something I've considered a lot after reading Andrew Brooks review of 'Wayward Lives'.
            In reviewing Hartman, Brooks defines fugitivity for the reader as an attempt to resist the constraints imposed by dominant systems of power.
            The fugitive attempts to live freely under oppressive conditions through methods of evasion.

            Last year I wrote about primitive hypertext as a methodology for 'creative resistance'.
            In writing and conceiving of how to link hypertext to a process or methodology I leaned upon Michel De Certeau and his 1980 book 'The practice of everyday living'
        In this book de Certeau writes broadly about how our bodies navigate networks an spaces.
        More specifically, de Certeau discusses how economic and social forces implemented by systems of power affect our ability to navigate the world.
        De Certeau calls the combination of these forces the 'grid of discipline.'
        These economic and social forces enable institutions to maintain the status quo and perpetuate the functionalist reality we exist within.
        Self expression is stifled in the necessity to make ends meet and interests are given less value than they deserve in a capitalist structure.
        I wrote about using primitive hypertext as a means to be unbound and infinitie. To be illegible. To make meaning in whichever way makes sense for me, and to be guided by that.

            To be illegible is to be engaging in fugitivity.
